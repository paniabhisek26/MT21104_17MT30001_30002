#Hybrid Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing for Image Contrast Enhancement
The MATLAB code for enhancing the contrast of gray-scale images using various methods can be found in this repo. These include ant colony optimization, genetic algorithm, and simulated annealing, which generate a global transfer function to convert input images to higher contrast ones, while trying to keep the natural look of the images.

The method works by placing a few artificial agents (aka artificial ants) in a search space to generate a transfer function useful for converting any image to a higher contrast one. The ants start from the origin of the transfer function (bottom left) and move to the top right point of that. 

The Code
The MATLAB code in the file imenhance.m, under the im-enhance folder, contains the function to perform the image contrast enhancement. The function takes the input image and two optional arguments, one for the number of iterations and the other for disabling the simulated annealing if preferred to increase speed and probably at some performance cost.
